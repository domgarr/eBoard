# eBoardWebApp
A WebApp that connects to BTE to control Electronic Scoreboards.

eBoard uses Bluetooth API developed by Google.

The app is testing in Chrome, only supports Chrome and is built with mobile in mind. With that in mind, the desktop version of this webapp looks horrible.

## Purpose
In a previous project I built an Electronic Scoreboard which was controlled a Smartwatch. I later added push buttons to control the Scoreboard. The reason for needing a scoreboard controlled by a watch - so that I could play and keep score - slowly disappeared as more and more people joined the volleyball league I would play at. I later would build an android app to control the scoreboard. The problem with that app was that Iphone users couldn't control the scoreboard. Finally, I decided to make a webapp in Angular, which is overkill ofcourse, but I wanted to improve my skills in this technology. Now there is a webapp that anyone can visit. All that is needed is google chrome.

## TODO:
- I would like the app to fill the whole page and not scroll.
- Fix BLE loading icon while connecting. It needs the size reduced.
